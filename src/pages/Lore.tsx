                    <p>Dwarves: The underground cousins of the elves. Also known as dark elves, many falsely believe dark elves and dwarves to be different.
                        The true reason for the "dark" adjective comes from the fact that they are covered in soot and coal.
                        In actuality, their skin color rivals that of snow due to lack of sunlight underground.
                        The pressure of the deep have also compressed their build giving them a more muscular and compact build.
